# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to analyze Amazon reviews written by members of the paid Amazon Vine program. The Amazon Vine program is a service that allows manufacturers and publishers to receive reviews for their products. Amazon Vine members are provided with the products for a small fee that is paid for by the manufacturer or publisher and the Amazon Vine member is required to publish a review after using the product.

## Summary
Within this analysis 51% of people that were paid for their reviews in the Vine program submitted a 5-Star review. Compare this to the 38.7% of 5-Star reviews for the people that are not in the Vine program and dont receive any benefit from submitting their review. With that being said, I do think there is some positivity bias for the reviews that came from the Vine program because the people that submitted those reviews think that there is a positive reinforcement to submitting a 5-Star review that they're getting paid for. An additional analysis I would like to test is to see what the breakdown of reviews were for the Vine program. What is the percentage of 1,2,3, and 4 Star reviews that were made from someone in the Vine program? I think this would be a good analysis to test for, so we could get a good breakdown on the other 49% of Vine reviews that were not 5-Stars.
